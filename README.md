# Helmet Configurator

## Problem Aspects Solvable by a Program

- Allowing users to visually customize helmet features (color, finish, size, decals, environment).
- Providing instant feedback and previews for selections.
- Streamlining the process of selecting and ordering a customized helmet.

## Changes to the Original Process

- Replaces manual or paper-based selection with an interactive web interface.
- Reduces errors and ambiguity in customer choices.
- Speeds up the configuration and ordering process.

## Program Requirements

- Intuitive UI for customization.
- Real-time state management for selections.
- Responsive design for various devices.
- Integration with product images and environment maps.
- Option to add products to basket or find a dealer.

## Changes to the Operating Model

- Customers interact directly with the configurator, reducing the need for sales staff intervention.
- Dealers receive more accurate, pre-configured orders.
- The process becomes more self-service and scalable.

## Business Benefits: Customer Retention

- **Personalization:** Customers can tailor products to their preferences, increasing satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Engagement:** Interactive experience encourages longer site visits and repeat usage.
- **Accuracy:** Reduces errors in orders, improving customer trust and reducing returns.
- **Self-Service:** Empowers customers to explore options independently, freeing up sales resources.

## Technical Benefits: SEO

- **Client-Side Rendering:** Fast, interactive UI improves user experience metrics (dwell time, bounce rate).
- **Semantic HTML:** Use of headings, alt tags, and accessible navigation helps search engines index content.
- **Shareable URLs:** Configurator can be extended to generate shareable links for specific configurations.
- **Performance:** Lightweight, static deployment ensures fast load times, which is favored by search engines.

## Software Architecture

- Client-side React application (see `components/overlay/Overlay.js`).
- State managed with Valtio (`utils/store.jsx`).
- Modular component structure for maintainability.
- Static assets served from `public/`.

**Reasoning:**  
This architecture enables fast, interactive UI updates and easy extensibility for new features.

## Ensuring Correct Functioning

- Use of React and Valtio for predictable state management.
- Unit and integration tests (can be added for critical logic).
- Manual testing of UI flows.
- Error boundaries and fallback UI for robustness.

## Usability Considerations

- Clear navigation between intro and customization.
- Visual feedback for selections (active states).
- Accessible buttons and labels.
- Responsive layout for different devices.
- Tooltips and tips for user guidance.

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Start from the intro screen and click "Customize".
3. Select helmet options: finish, aspect, size, decals, environment.
4. Review the total price.
5. Add to basket or find a dealer for purchase.
